Morse Code Decoder using PIL

This script takes an specially crafted image, which should have an specific widht and height (25x3, respectively; it can also work with larger height but using the same width), it must include morse code in its pixels, and only using two colors. The Python PIL library will be used to extract the morse code from the image, and then with some string manipulation we will be able to decode the morse code into ASCII characters.

The images should have this layout:

This script was done in order to solve a *MISC* challenge on a hacking website that i won't disclose, if you found this repository trying to solve THAT challenge feel free to PM me.
